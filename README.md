Applied Data Science Capstone (included each labs and the source file)
Project/assignment notebooks for courses 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are included in this repository. Courses 1 and 3 only have quizzes as part of their assignments. Hence, there are no notebooks for them.

The Applied Data Science Capstone consists of several Jupyter Notebook files, each corresponding to different project segments completed weekly throughout the duration of the project. These include:

An introductory document for the capstone project in week 1 of the course, an assignment notebook for week 3, and a PDF outlining the project's introduction and data collection for week 4 are available. Additionally, the week 5 materials, including the final project notebook, project report, and project presentation, can be accessed. All these files are accessible at  
https://github.com/BelkisCeri/Capstone-Project.

Please note that the Coursera_Capstone repository is utilized for all capstone course submissions. 
For the full set of materials, including the report and presentation, please visit the Coursera_Capstone repository.
